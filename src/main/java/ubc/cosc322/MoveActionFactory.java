 *
 * The MoveActionFactory class is responsible for generating all possible actions
 * in a given game state for the player. 
 * 
 * An action consists of a queen's movement from its current position to a target position, followed by shooting an arrow to a target 
 * position from the new queen's location. This class iterates through all possible queen positions, possible queen movements, 
 * and possible arrow shooting positions, taking into account the current state of the board and blocking conditions.
